# What is this
This is a dashboard built to track data of Russian missile attacks. Originally built by [Yasir Atalan](https://www.csis.org/people/yasir-atalan) of the CSIS Futures Lab. It is built with Python and [Plotly's Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) framework. 

Any changes to the dashboard should be requested by or cleared by Yasir or the Futures Lab. The iLab handles deployment, including the Google Sheet updates, the refresh thread, and the connection to Railway. 

It originally pulled data from local CSVs but has been modified to pull from [a Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kb1nL2IgkOXmnSwkAoqnqVq05lXt0U0P1yRIvJk_0j4/edit?usp=sharing) every 24 hours. The spreadsheet is owned by the CSIS iLab gmail account and set to view-only. Editor access must be granted by csisideaslab@gmail.com.

## Deployment
The project is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.com/). The account used is tied to the ilabwebdev@csis.org email address. To login, enter the email address and wait until you are sent a link with a code to enter. Enter the code and the login page should refresh. The account is paid for via a card provided by Yasir; contact him to confirm or modify the payment information.
